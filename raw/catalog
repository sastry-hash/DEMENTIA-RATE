This project is based on three core datasets. The first dataset contains population estimates by single year of age and local authority, which are used to calculate total population figures as well as the population aged 65 and over, serving as the demographic denominator for dementia rate analysis. The second dataset consists of reported dementia indicators, providing counts of people diagnosed with or recorded as having dementia across NHS geographic areas such as Sub-ICBs, along with reporting dates and measurement categories; this dataset forms the numerator for dementia prevalence calculations. The third dataset is a geographic lookup table that maps Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) to Sub-ICB, ICB, and local authority codes and names, enabling the integration of health data with local authority–level population data and ensuring consistent geographic alignment across all analyses.
